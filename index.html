<p>FoCuS-point is stand-alone software for TCSPC correlation and analysis. FoCuS-point utilizes advanced time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) correlation algorithms along with time-gated filtering and innovative data visualization. The software has been designed to be highly user-friendly and is tailored to handle batches of data with tools designed to process files in bulk. FoCuS-point also includes advanced diffusion curve fitting algorithms which allow the parameters of the correlation functions and thus the kinetics of diffusion to be established quickly and efficiently. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26589275">FoCuS-point published paper</a>

<p>What is FCS? Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy is a statistical approach for studying diffusion in fluorescently tagged molecular species. How does this work? The rate of diffusion can be established by measuring the periodic self-similarity (correlation) of fluctuations within a time-series of fluorescence recordings. What is TCSPC? Time Correlated Single Photon Counting is used when you have photon detectors sufficiently sensitive enough to detect the arrival of individual photons. </p>

<p>FoCuS-point can correlate .pt3 and .ptu files created using PicoQuant correlation systems as described on the <a href="https://www.picoquant.com/products/category/tcspc-and-time-tagging-modules">PicoQuant website.</a>
